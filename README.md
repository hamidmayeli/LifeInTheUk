# Life in the UK Practice

## Get Ready to pass your Life in the UK test for FREE!

This Web App is designed to help you to get ready for your test in the shortest time possible.

It contains **16** tests that are essential for the test. But there are enough as well. I passed my exam using only these questions. You can find these questions on other websites too. But the key difference here is that you can install this web app on your device. Also, it is user-friendly.

> I have created this to get myself familiar with GitHub Actions and Page. Also, refresh my memory in React, Jest and testing in JavaScript.
